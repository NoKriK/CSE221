\subsubsection{Size of file cache}

// NOTE
Note that this may be very sensitive to other load on the machine. Report results as a graph whose x-axis is the size of the file being accessed and the y-axis is the average read I/O time. Do not use a system call or utility program to determine this metric except to sanity check.

\subsubsection{File read time}

//NOTE
Report for both sequential and random access as a function of file size. Discuss the sense in which your "sequential" access might not be sequential. Ensure that you are not measuring cached data (e.g., use the raw device interface). Report as a graph with a log/log plot with the x-axis the size of the file and y-axis the average per-block time.

\subsubsection{Remote file read time}
//NOTE
Repeat the previous experiment for a remote file system. What is the "network penalty" of accessing files over the network?

\subsubsection{Contention}
//NOTE
Report the average time to read one file system block of data as a function of the number of processes simultaneously performing the same operation on different files on the same disk (and not in the file buffer cache).
